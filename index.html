           <strong>Paragraph 1 — Everything about it:</strong>
           <em>The Habra house in India has been around for almost 50 years and was built by Jiban Krishna Guahroy.</em>
            <strong>It is a unique house and has many features that make it stand out from other houses. The house is made of yellow bricks and has an enormous, spacious roof. It also has many windows that allow natural light to come in. The house is very spacious and has plenty of room for the family to live in.</strong><br>
            <mark>This house is located on <strong>Subhas Road, Habra, West Bengal, India</strong>, which is one of the busiest streets and makes it stand out.</mark>
            Its interior is clean and has many rooms used for different purposes. The house also has a number of unique features, such as a large balcony that overlooks the street below. Overall, the Habra house is interesting and worth checking out if you are ever in the area.<br><br>
            The house is located in a busy area, so it is important to be careful when walking around. The house is also very close to many shops, so it is easy to find something to eat or do while you are there.<br><br>
            One of the most unique things about this house is its enormous garden, which even has a well — something some houses do not have.
            <i>The garden is well maintained and is swept with a broom almost every day.<br><br>
    The line shown below divides each paragraph into a section so it is easier to read and understand the text.

           <strong><del>Second paragraph: what the inside looks like and each room</del></strong>
           <strong>Paragraph 2 — What you might see when you look at the house closely:</strong><br>
           <i>When you first see this house, you will notice two tall trees in the front that have been carefully planted and cared for.</i>
           After you pass the trees, you will see small yellow steps and next to them a rectangular prism that contains all sorts of seashells.
           After seeing that, you will notice a large purple door that is decorative and looks like a door.
            <strong>When you enter the house, you will see a large living room with many pieces of furniture. The furniture is old but comfortable. The living room also has decorations that make it look nice.</strong>

            <mark>The living room also has a large window that allows natural light to come in. The window has curtains that can be used to block the light if needed.</mark><br>
            <em>Next to the living room is a large kitchen with a table, fridge, sink, and many kitchen utensils.</em><br>

            Next to the kitchen is the room of the builder and owner, Jiban Krishna Guahroy. His room is large and contains furniture that is old but comfortable. The room also has many decorations that make it look nice.<br><br>
         
            The room also has a large window that allows natural light to come in. The window has curtains that can be used to block the light if needed.<br><br>
        
            There are many different old and unique things in his bedroom that make it stand out.


            In India there are many mosquitoes, and houses often use mosquito nets when going to bed to prevent bites during the night. Mosquito nets are helpful for keeping insects away.<br><br>

            <strong>Paragraph 3 — Everything about the second floor:</strong>

            <em>Since we described the first floor, it's time to move on to the second floor.</em>

            The second floor is large and has two bedrooms and a balcony that overlooks the street below. The balcony is spacious and contains furniture that has been around a long time but remains comfortable. The balcony is decorated and pleasant to use.<br><br>
            The first bedroom is basically the master bedroom and has plenty of furniture and the largest mosquito net in the house.
            The second bedroom is basically the same but a little smaller than the first bedroom.
            Both floors have bathrooms that are basically the same size, but the one on the second floor has a little more space and is quite clean.
            <strong>Both floors have a TV, but the one on the first floor is larger. Interestingly, when the house was first built, it included a television that has been around for almost 50 years.</strong>
            <i>The floor is smooth since it is thoroughly cleaned every day with a mop.</i>
            Next to the <q>master bedroom</q> there is a large closet that fits a lot of clothes and belongings.
            There is also a purple window beside the table near the closet — it is decorative.
            Next to the upstairs bathroom is a place where bedcovers and other necessary household supplies are stored.<br><br>

            <strong>Paragraph 4 — The outside</strong>
            Outside the Habra house is a large field with trees that grow many different fruits and vegetables, providing extra supplies for the household.
            <i>The outside area is nice and even has its own well that was built when the house was first made, about 50 years ago.</i>
            The house also has a structure that carries water from the sink to a pond outside the house.
            Sometimes the people who live in the house notice different types of fruits growing on the trees. Because the trees are tall, they hire people to climb and pick the fruit for a fee.
            <strong>The field also has a fence to keep people out, but the fence is high enough that someone tall can see the road.</strong><br><br>

            <strong>Paragraph 5 — The front of the house</strong><br>
            The front of the house is large and has many features that make it look nice. The house has a big gate that is used to keep people out. The gate is old but still sturdy. The front of the house also has decorations that make it look attractive.
            <i>It also has a large driveway for parking cars. The driveway provides plenty of space for vehicles.</i>
            There is a place to store shoes so the inside of the house doesn't get dirty from outside.
            An interesting feature is a sitting area made from fake seashells that are glued together to look like a bench.
            <mark>The front of the house also has a large window that allows natural light to enter. The window has curtains that can be used to block the light if needed.</mark><br><br>

            <strong>Paragraph 7 — The balcony</strong>
            <i>The Habra house's balcony is very large and has a lot of space to dry clothes after washing.</i>
            <strong>Since India is a hot country (Kolkata and West Bengal are especially warm), a lot of sunlight reaches the balcony. Because the house is tall, the balcony is one of the sunniest parts of the home, and the higher you are, the more sunlight and heat you get.</strong>
            From the top, you can see the whole street, cars, people passing by, the sky, and the big field behind the house.
            Beside the balcony are very old items that have been around for 50 years; they were used when the house was first built by Jiban Krishna Guahroy's daughter, Banhisikha Guahroy.
            It also has toys and a slide that were used by Banhisikha Guahroy's children when they were little.<br><br>
